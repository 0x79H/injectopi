/**
* @brief The NtMapViewOfSection routine maps a view of a section into the
virtual address space of a subject process.
* @param SectionHandle Handle to a section object. This handle is created by a
successful call to ZwCreateSection or ZwOpenSection.
* @param ProcessHandle Handle to the object that represents the process that the
view should be mapped into. Use the ZwCurrentProcess macro to specify the
current process. The handle must have been opened with PROCESS_VM_OPERATION
access (described in the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation).
* @param BaseAddress Pointer to a variable that receives the base address of the
view. If the value of this parameter is not NULL, the view is allocated starting
at the specified virtual address rounded down to the next 64-kilobyte address
boundary.
* @param ZeroBits  Specifies the number of high-order address bits that must be
zero in the base address of the section view. The value of this parameter must
be less than 21 and is used only if BaseAddress is NULLâ€”in other words, when the
caller allows the system to determine where to allocate the view.
* @param CommitSize Specifies the size, in bytes, of the initially committed
region of the view. CommitSize is meaningful only for page-file backed sections
and is rounded up to the nearest multiple of PAGE_SIZE. (For sections that map
files, both the data and the image are committed at section-creation time.)
* @param SectionOffset A pointer to a variable that receives the offset, in
bytes, from the beginning of the section to the view. If this pointer is not
NULL, the offset is rounded down to the next allocation-granularity size
boundary.
* @param ViewSize
A pointer to a SIZE_T variable. If the initial value of this variable is zero,
ZwMapViewOfSection maps a view of the section that starts at SectionOffset and
continues to the end of the section. Otherwise, the initial value specifies the
view's size, in bytes. ZwMapViewOfSection always rounds this value up to the
nearest multiple of PAGE_SIZE before mapping the view.
On return, the value receives the actual size, in bytes, of the view.
* @param InheritDisposition Specifies how the view is to be shared with child
processes.
* @param AllocationType Specifies a set of flags that describes the type of
allocation to be performed for the specified region of pages. The valid flags
are MEM_LARGE_PAGES, MEM_RESERVE, and MEM_TOP_DOWN. Although MEM_COMMIT is not
allowed, it is implied unless MEM_RESERVE is specified. For more information
about the MEM_XXX flags, see the description of the VirtualAlloc routine.
* @param Win32Protect Specifies the type of protection for the region of
initially committed pages. Device and intermediate drivers should set this value
to PAGE_READWRITE.
* @return NtMapViewOfSection returns an NTSTATUS value.
